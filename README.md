# ENGR103-Final
**This is similar to the game Bop it. You hold the hardware with the cord going up, and it'll turn either red green or blue**<br><br>
**Red: make noise to get the point (or just blow on it)**<br>
**Green: hit the left button to get the point**<br>
**Blue: hit the right button to get the poin** <br><br>
It will tell you if you score or lost the point, and if you lose it will beep at you. Or, if it hates you, it'll just beep at you wheneevr it feels like doing so. This is a very special game, it it judgemental and takes matters into its own hands whenever it feels like it so it's spontaneous which adds a lot of fun to the game if you ask me.
